# PyTorch-Course
I've created this repo as part of my Udemy course progress.
It's mainly a personal backup and a way to share what I'm learning ðŸ˜Š.

All the code uploaded here has been recreated and modified by me for learning purposes only.
If I'm unknowingly violating any license or terms, please let me know and I will remove or make the content private. 
I'm still new to the software development world and learning as I go.

This course requires about 52 hours to complete, but taking into consideration i'm doing the "extracurricular" things to maybe it 
will take me a little more.
